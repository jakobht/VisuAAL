# Visualizing Behavior of Distributed Network Protocols using UPPAAL Simulations

If you load an UPPAAL model for a distributed network protocol into this application you can get usefull insight of what is actually going on in the protocol. 
The parameters that make sense to configure should be prefixed with CONFIG_
The variables that makes sense to observe during simulations shold be prefixed with OUTPUT_

This tool is still very much work in process, developed as part of a master thesis on Aalborg University.
